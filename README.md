# predicting-depression

Playing around with different ML techniques/tools on an interesting dataset I found online. I think it'd open a lot of doors to be able to do something like this in mental healthcare contexts.

Dataset: https://datasets.simula.no/depresjon/#download

Ideas:
* Use LSTM/RNN to forecast the future activity of the person in a multivariate manner (maybe include weekday data into this as well as a statistic)
* Classify the activity time series to determine if someone is depressed (use Random Forest, or Deep Neural Network with a balancing scheme)
